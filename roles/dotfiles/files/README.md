## Hammerspoon Setup

A fork of wincent dotfiles [github][1], I have modified it quite a bit.
This is a ongoing project and will be refined as it goes. 
It will get messy. But will refine as we go.

# Installation

This is part of wincent dotfiles. refer to [here][2]

## TODO

Would like to explore more how efficient I can make my computer setup
- Cleanup
- Make tmux change depending on the layout
- Can you get chrome devtools in terminal when deving
- Hyperkey combo to split layout to Home + Bolster or Active
- Workout what other files other than init.lua does and start separating out init to individual functions.
- Hammerspoon to detect if second screen is plugged in
- Make depending on presence of dev tools to change formation
- toggle from terminal to chrome to exclude dev tools
- Make chrome profile toggle much like the terminal to chrome toggle
